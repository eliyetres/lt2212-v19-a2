## Additional instructions

Only part 1 is done so far, working on the remainder!

I created an error message when trying to trunkate to dimensions higher than the vocabulary count. The terminal prints the error message: "Error: Singular value decomposition dimensions must be lower than vocabulary limit." and exits without errors.

## Results and discussion

All the output files are in the LT2212 folder on the server. 

### Vocabulary restriction.

Running anything using the full vocabulary resulted in a MemoryError on my computer, so i ran the files in the server. For output 2 I limited the words to the top 50.

### Result table

(Try to use the Markdown table format for this.)

### The hypothesis in your own words

### Discussion of trends in results in light of the hypothesis
