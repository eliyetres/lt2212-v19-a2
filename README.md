## Additional instructions

Only part 1 is done so far, working on the remainder!

## Results and discussion

I haven't been able to do question 6, after a couple of minutes I get "MemoryError". I managed to run it on the server.

### Vocabulary restriction.

I used a vocabulary restriction of 25 because after 25 there are almost no matches, and 25 seems to be a number my computer can handle.

### Result table

(Try to use the Markdown table format for this.)

### The hypothesis in your own words

### Discussion of trends in results in light of the hypothesis
